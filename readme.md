# Veector

Basic operators on `CGVector` in Swift.

Because everyone is doing it.

## Usage

Veector is a Swift Framework. Build it and add it to your iOS 8 or Mac OS project. Or 
maybe if anyone wants it I'll release it as a CocoaPod, or configure it so it plays nicely
with Carthage.

```Swift
var a = CGVector(dx: 3, dy: 7)
let b = CGVector(dx: 4, dy: 2)
var c = a - b // c is now <-1, 5>

a -= b // a is now <-1, 5>

a = CGVector(dx: 3, dy: 7)

c = a + b // c is now <7, 9>

let v = CGVector(dx: 3, dy: 4)
magnitude(v) // returns 5
normalize(v) // returns a vector with the same direction as v and a magnitude of 1

a = CGVector(dx: 3, dy: 7)
let p1 = CGPoint(x: 4, y: 2)
let p2 = p + a // p2 is a point at <7, 9>

a = CGVector(dx: 3, dy: 7)
b = CGVector(dx: 3, dy: 7)
a â€¢ b // == 58
```
